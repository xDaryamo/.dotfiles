# Hyprland Dotfiles

My Personal configuration files for my Wayland-based Arch Linux setup using **Hyprland**
This repository contains all of my `.config` files, scripts, themes, and UI customizations.

These dotfiles allow me to easily back up, track, and share my Linux Rice.

## 🎨 Matugen Integration

The entire rice is designed around **[Matugen](https://github.com/InioX/matugen)**, which dynamically generates colors based on your wallpaper or a selected palette.

- Global theme consistency  
- Automatic color injection into Hyprland, Waybar, Starship, Rofi, GTK, etc.  
- No unnecessary icons, backgrounds, or decorations added — only coherent colors  
- Fast theme updates with a single command  

Matugen is the central core of the theming system.
